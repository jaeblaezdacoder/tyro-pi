...is my repository for Raspberry Pi beginners. This is just a basic *Getting Started* repo for some of the most common tasks in one place.
---
1. Download Pi Imager --> [Official Raspberry-Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Insert microSD card into card slot on your computer. (I recommend 64GB microSD card at minimum)
- For this setup, we will be installing a 64-bit version of the PI OS manually.
- I have included the Pi OS image file in the Pi-Images folder in this repo.
